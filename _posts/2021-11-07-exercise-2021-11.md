# November exercise report
The penultimate of these! A month which included a cheeky trip to see a friend in Germany (yes, prior to COVID spike). Even managed a run around the city.

Last month included [a half marathon](https://colinpattinson.github.io/exercise-2021-10/), this month had less events but still some solid numbers.

## Context
Less running but a decent mix of other activities. 

### Activities 
This is what I did…

#### What activities?
This month included:

<iframe title="Count of activities in November" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-qkc9H" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qkc9H/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="277"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

26 total activities in 30 days. One less day in the month but 1 extra activity than last month.

#### Totals & averages
Exercising:
- total miles: 151.27 miles. Up from 108.06 miles last month. Not too shabby. More cycling is the big contributor. 
- in 2021 I have now racked up over 1661.84 miles. 1 month to go. Lets see if I can get over 1750 miles to end the year. 

Time:
- total time taken: 24.3 hours. It is strange to think 1 whole day of my month was doing some form of exercise. 
- average exercise time: 56 minutes, an increase but by a smidgen. 

#### What else?
Facts and figures:
- longest distance was a 13.25 mile cycle. 
- lowest distance was a 3.81 mile walk 
- fastest run was at the 8 mins 11 secs per mile mark. Bit slower but no longer in training for a half marathon so being more leisurely.

## Perspective
Made some life decisions this month. All very exciting and looking forward to a new future ahead. Also got to see many friends from studying in China days, which was wonderful. So nice how we stay connected despite time and distance.

## What next?
Last month of my year of doing these. Thank goodness. I’ve done a year of weeknotes. Now a month of exercise notes. I literally have no idea what I’ll be recording for 2022.
