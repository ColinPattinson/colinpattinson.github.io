# Anniversary
I am celebrating my 1 year anniversary at Kry today. It’s been a fun ride with [some ups and downs](https://sifted.eu/articles/kry-path-to-profitable-2023/). I'm going to share 3 of the gang's recent wins (there have been more, but these are the ones I've reviewed recently!)...

## Move to a new platform
One of the first things we did as a brand new team was move from an old platform to a new one. A lot of previous functions and features needed to be moved over, and we had the opportunity to lift & shift or to do better / cull bad stuff. The team hustled away, hit deadlines, and also unpicked and improved some of the previous journeys we were tasked with replicating. 

An example I remember fondly is making the use of templates much more efficient and effective. Clinicians have a bunch of templates they can use to message patients and we didn’t just move them over we invested time to understand the whole service. We did things such as: 
- establishing a new process on how new templates or existing templates are updated with colleagues there to aid making them great
- switched where they were stored
- a full content audit of existing templates to see if the content could be improved and culled some ones that no longer were in use.

Overall, thanks to the dedication of loads of teams (definitely not just our team) we have seen that our clinician efficiency metrics are far better on the new platform. In fact it is almost double-y as good depending on the type of shift you are doing. 

## Voice as Fallback
Another early success was an endeavour began by another colleague but picked up by me. Like any health organisation we don’t really love no shows (so when a patient doesn’t/can’t turn up for their appointment). It essentially eats up time in a queue and means clinicians can sit idle when other patients could of been seen.
For remote meetings we often schedule a video meeting that is conducted over the internet but obviously sometimes things don’t work out perfectly on the patient end and they don’t pick up their video meeting when called or the connection is a bit ropey so they can’t complete the meeting. In this type of context we decided to roll out a way a clinician can begin a VoIP call but it actually calls the patients mobile phone via mobile networks. The thinking being we could turn potential no shows into possible completed meetings.

The results are actually pretty amazing:
- Potentially saved 69.3% of meetings that would have been no shows by being able to talk to the patient over the phone. Only 5.7% did not answer the phone at all.  
- The highest average patient grade of all meeting types (so more popular than video for example)
- Rolled across x2 markets with hundreds of clinicians using the feature for thousands of meetings.

## Switching costs
Very recently we made a switch of provider in a particular market after I got curious about a decision made many months ago. After digging through contracts & invoices we made a call to switch. I had a little criteria list to judge if the change was positive or at minimum did no harm.

Results included:
- 54.6% cost reduction
- Higher patient satisfaction grade
- Reduced no shows by 41.2%

It’s mundane work perhaps and not the most sexy work but results are results. 

### Team Happiness
This really should be number one but I have to throw it in as an added extra.

It’s very important you find joy with the people you work with and I know I found a wonderful group of people to spend many hours with. Many laughs have been shared, many emoji’s were sent. We’ve had a few comm-rades since I joined. All of them have been a blast which is pretty rare. I look forward to seeing a bunch of them in person soon, new & old and keep plugging away to fast forward the future of healthcare.

Here is to my anniversary!
