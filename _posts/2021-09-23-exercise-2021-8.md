# August exercise report
[July feels like a lifetime ago](https://colinpattinson.github.io/exercise-2021-7/) as I write this in late September. I’ve booked myself into a half marathon in the next few weeks so lots of August and September is getting into training mode. A holiday was also taken… which was wonderful…

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I took this photo yesterday on a little walk. It doesn&#39;t feel real. <a href="https://t.co/ae3Ap2snmL">pic.twitter.com/ae3Ap2snmL</a></p>&mdash; Colin Pattinson (@ColinPattinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/1432651600498241545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

## Context
By the looks of it… only 1 day of the month had no activity.

### Activities 
This is what I did…

#### What activities?
This month included:

<iframe title="Count of activities" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-STjx1" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/STjx1/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="277"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

42 total activities in 31 days. This might be peak exercise. Let’s see! Increase from 37 last month.

#### Totals & averages
Exercising:
- total miles: 231.58 miles. Pretty much a 50 mile increase from last month. 
- in 2021 I have now racked up over 1273.15 miles.

Time:
- total time taken: 36 hours 28 minutes. An increase from last month.
- average exercise time: 56 minutes. Also an increase.

#### What else?
Facts and figures:
- longest distance was a 21.24 mile cycle. 
- lowest distance was a 2.56 mile walk 
- fastest run was at the 7:44 mins per mile mark. Decent going. Need to keep this up.

## Perspective
I have been growing tomatoes. I am very proud of them. It’s been a real journey. I recommend it. Home grown tomatoes taste very very very tomato-y.

## What next?
I am in late September. I can confirm some amazing runs in sunshine.
