# July exercise report
[June included 3 hikes](https://colinpattinson.github.io/exercise-2021-6/) and this month saw me go high-intensity interval training crazy. A PB in total HIIT sessions. I wish I could say I tried every Olympic event this month but I didn‚Äôt (although after typing that last sentence that would be a fun thing to do for 2022). 

The funnest activity this month was likely a wild swim in [a tidal pool in Margate, the largest saltwater pool in the country](https://www.ft.com/content/5459aeb8-8149-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff). It was slimy and exhilarating.

Here is a shot I took when the tide was out.

## Context
Some time off bopping around Kent. Have some new equipment for some more upper body exercises.

### Activities 
This is what I did‚Ä¶

#### What activities?
This month included:

<iframe title="Count of activities in July" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-knjfj" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/knjfj/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="281"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

If my count is true then that is 37 activities in 31 days. A lot more than the 24 last month.

#### Totals & averages
Exercising:
- total miles: 181.63 miles. Up by over 30 miles from last month. 
- in 2021 I have now racked up over 1041 miles. Newcastle to London is around 250 miles. So I basically could have done that journey x4 times. 

Time:
- total time taken: 29 hours 14 minutes.
- average exercise time: 48.5 minutes. No hiking this month means less skewing of numbers.

#### What else?
Facts and figures:
- longest distance was a 14.5 mile cycle. Which as I type this‚Ä¶ I cannot even remember what on earth I was doing
- lowest distance was a 2.48 mile walk 
- not many fast runs this month. Mostly hovered around the 8:15 mins per mile mark. 

## Perspective
I got my second vaccine. Yay science.

I saw the best thing I‚Äôve seen in the theatre in a very long time this month‚Ä¶

A real joy and 100% worth seeing. <a href="https://t.co/vPv8zMNQv3">https://t.co/vPv8zMNQv3</a></p>&mdash; Colin Pattinson (@ColinPattinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/1416161784663355397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I technically [wrote another blog post yesterday too](https://colinpattinson.github.io/data-as-art/). I guess you could say that it is a ramble about some arts and crafts I did one Saturday in July.

## What next?
This month I will go on an adventure. Well‚Ä¶ I keep my fingers crossed that rules stay in place that I can go. It should be a lot of fun. Not sure how it will affect exercise but I shall prioritise joy.
