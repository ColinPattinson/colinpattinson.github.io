# Theatre End of Year Review
In [2019 I ranked all my theatre trips](https://colinpattinson.github.io/theatre-review/) and as I sit here, freshly boosted against COVID, I feel the urge to have another spin at it.

Obviously, there is no getting around it. It’s been a weird year. Getting to see any theatre is a privilege and it is not lost on me that I was lucky to see so much. Reader, be reliably informed many lateral flow tests were taken. Many proof of vaccines was shown.

## Stats
2018 saw 23 visits to the theatre, 2019 saw 20… let's forget about 2020… 2021 saw 12! Quite a few got canceled/moved (as one would expect). 12 is pretty good though… given the first only happened on my birthday in late May.

I tend to scour the web for best priced seats and usually take a partner in crime along with me. Tickets usually are in the £15 to £40 ballpark. Roughly the seat quality is usually similar.

### Rankings

**12) [Bach and sons](https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/bach-and-sons/) (Bridge Theatre)**

> Johann Sebastian Bach, irascible and turbulent, writes music of sensuous delight for his aristocratic patrons, and gives voice to his deep religious faith in music for the church. He’s touchy, he’s fabulously rude, he has high standards (he stabs a bassoonist for playing badly) and he’s constantly in trouble with his employers… As the years pass, their gripping family drama provokes furious arguments about love, God and above all music.

Absolutely not terrible, just “fine”. Can’t remember it all too well but remember thinking that was ok. Then walking off and forgetting lots about it. Bridge Theatre a great venue though, typically awesome seats and good productions so a safe floor if something on there.

**11) [Paradise](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/paradise) (National Theatre)**

> Philoctetes: once a celebrated wartime hero, now a wounded outcast on a desolate island. When a young soldier appears, his hope of escape comes with suspicion. And as an old enemy also emerges, he is faced with an even greater temptation: revenge.

Loved the all female cast, loved the setting. Been reading a lot of Greek mythology this year. Maybe I was too close to someone coughing but just didn’t quite get into it as much as I’d hoped. It was better than fine. It was on the lower end of good. Was hoping to be wow’d.

**10) [The Prince of Egypt](https://www.theprinceofegyptmusical.com/) (Dominion Theatre)**

> Based on the classic DreamWorks Animation film and featuring Stephen Schwartz’s “miraculous music” (Time Out) – including his Academy Award®-winning song ‘When You Believe’ – and Sean Cheesman’s “astonishing choreography” (The Guardian), this epic production with a cast and orchestra of more than 60 artists tells an inspiring tale of resilience and hope. 

Now… let's not beat around the bush… this is total pants. Most of it was just plain silly… however, I hung out with the legend that is [Sharan](https://twitter.com/sharandhaliwal) ( [she wrote a book that you should buy](https://www.waterstones.com/book/burnt-roti/sharan-dhaliwal/9781784884390) ) and it was a hoot filled with many giggles and snacks. I’d give it credit for an actual very tastefully done presentation of plague deaths and high production finale. Also at the end the actors blasted gov policies of the arts. Was not the first show when the actors went rogue to make a political point (which I applaud their bravery).

**9) [Manor](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/manor) (National Theatre)**

> A storm is brewing. Diana is struggling to keep the roof on her run-down manor house. As a violent storm sweeps the coast, a group of strangers unexpectedly arrive in search of shelter. Enter Ted, the charismatic leader of a far-right organisation. He could be Diana’s saviour – or he could pull the fragile household to pieces. Stranded together, the explosive mix of people must survive the weather and each other.

Was pretty good. A sorta chiller/thriller. I was kinda hoping for a more gruesome ending after all the preceding scenes. Well acted, political and vibe was well done. Mate and I also drank a hot chocolate at the interval. Which I’d never done before but really perked me up for the second part of the production.

**8) [Cinderella](https://andrewlloydwebberscinderella.com/) (Gillian Lynne Theatre)**

Interesting one… took nieces to see it. Boy, that might have been a big mistake. Uncle Colin, had not anticipated how rude the production was. At no point had I expected my 7 year old niece to turn to me and say “uncle Colin, what is a brothel?”. That being said, much of it was very fun and high production values. Good, don’t take under 8’s.

**7) [The Shark is Broken](https://www.theambassadorstheatre.co.uk/shows/the-shark-is-broken) (Ambassador’s Theatre)**

> Martha’s Vineyard, 1974: shooting on ‘Jaws’ has stalled. The film’s lead actors – Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss – are stuck on a boat, at the mercy of foul weather and a faulty mechanical co-star. Awash with alcohol and ambition, three hammered sharks start to bare their teeth…

Great acting, had 6+ laughs, fun insight. The story of the contentious filming of Jaws. Would recommend it. Liberal use of the word “boy” as a demeaning term made me chuckle. 

**6) [Flight](https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/flight/) (National Theatre)**

> From a private booth, you’ll be drawn in close to this tale of orphaned brothers and their desperate odyssey across Europe, the action unfolding in an exquisite world of miniatures moving before you. With their small inheritance stitched into their clothes, young Aryan and Kabir set off on an epic journey by foot from Kabul to London. Braving bustling train stations, hazardous sea crossings, menacing strangers and threats of violence, their heart wrenching story speaks of terror, hope and survival. 

For context… it was my birthday, it was the first theatre I had seen in over a year, it was literally the day I finally escaped from a narcissist and this show/exhibit is all about migrants trying to flee a warzone. Unsurprisingly things got emotional. It was beautiful and mesmerising. Not something you’d see again but worth seeing. 

**5) [Life of Pi](https://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk/whats-on/life-of-pi) (Wyndham’s Theatre)**

> After a cargo ship sinks in the middle of the vast Pacific Ocean, a sixteen year-old boy named Pi is stranded on a lifeboat with four other survivors - a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan, and a Royal Bengal tiger. Time is against them, nature is harsh, who will survive?

Loved the book originally. Production values are extremely good. I think this is Harry Potter levels of magical visuals while in the theatre. Thinking back there are genuinely some astounding scenes. The only drawbacks are that the show basically follows the narrative but naturally can’t sink quite to the emotional or philosophical depths of the book. 

**4) [Dear Evan Hansen](https://dearevanhansen.com/london/) (Noël Coward Theatre)**

> A timely and timeless new musical about struggling to connect in a hyperconnected world, DEAR EVAN HANSEN is the winner of 3 Olivier Awards for BEST NEW MUSICAL, BEST ORIGINAL SCORE and BEST ACTOR.

I’d never seen this before. It’s kinda an odd story as it plays out. Evan Hansen doesn’t really get the karma he might deserve (hot take) but other than that it is really fab. Great songs, good production. Hit the expectation I had of it.

**3) [The Normal Heart](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-normal-heart) (National Theatre)**

![The Normal Heart poster with two main actors](https://images.jg-cdn.com/image/15121e7d-3880-4909-bd8a-5d9f8a5894fa.jpg?template=PagesUIFeatureImage)

> Love, anger and activism during the 1980s AIDS crisis. A new virus is infecting gay men across New York City. As the rising death toll is ignored by the government and the medical establishment, fear and confusion turns to rage and division. Using this anger, writer and activist Ned Weeks sets out to unite the community in their fight for recognition and right to survive.

A weeper. So interesting to see this during a pandemic. Incredibly beautiful and made my heart swell. The acting in this was so good. Not really sure what to write other than it was incredible. From the valiant Ned Weeks to the absolutely crushing ignorance and abandonment of the government - all portrayed with such grace. At the end of the performance a number of people stood up in the audience to draw attention to a similar pain of living through the Thatcher years.

**2) [Be More Chill](https://www.bemorechillmusical.com/) (The Shaftesbury Theatre)**

![Be More Chill Poster](https://res.cloudinary.com/solt/image/upload/q_80:420,fl_progressive,f_auto/v1621263787/Be_More_Chill_1200x60_gyzdsw.jpg)

> It's just your atypical love story - a guy (he wants to fit in), a girl (she wants to be noticed), and the supercomputer inside the guy's head that tells him what to do (it wants to take over the world!).

A total surprise. Absolutely loved it. Listened to the soundtrack quite a lot this year. ‘Michael in the bathroom’ is an anthem. The whole show is a sorta tech sc-fi comedy musical so high chance of me enjoying it. It was punctuated with my mate having to submit a test online during the show but even that drama couldn’t detract from the show. Lots of fun. Would probably even go see again.

**1) [Anything Goes](https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2022/event/anything-goes) (Barbican Theatre)**

![Anything goes promo image with singers and dancers](https://www.touristengland.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Anything-Goes-extension.jpg)

> Featuring a 50 strong cast and ensemble of the finest we have to offer on the London stage (including tap dancing sailors!) and a full-sized live orchestra, this uplifting production of Anything Goes features heart-warming romance, farcical fun and spectacular show stopping dance routines.

I wasn’t expecting a ton. I cycled there with about 2 mins to spare before the show started. Had amazing seats fortunately and was just blown away. A whirlwind of joy for a few hours with incredible production, a fun 30’s setting and great singing, music and dancing. Can’t say anything more than it was a total delight. Left with a huge smile on my face and humming along ever since.

#### Favourite theatre visited this year
Hmmm… lets see… I’ll go with the National Theatre. Mostly because you can get amazing performances, at great prices and pretty much every seat has wonderful views. A real gem that I still enjoy visiting each time. You can also get hot chocolate there during the interval. 

#### 2022
6 performances already lined up in January alone.

Some highlights I’m looking forward to;

- [The Book of Dust](https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/the-book-of-dust/) at the Bridge Theatre
- Aaron Sorkin’s [To Kill A Mockingbird](https://www.tokillamockingbird.co.uk/)
- Mark Rylance back in [Jerusalem](https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/jerusalem/)

### Conclusion
Good mix of shows. Very happy to have seen any at all. Looking forward to 2022 with even more than 12! Time to go listen to the Be More Chill soundtrack.
