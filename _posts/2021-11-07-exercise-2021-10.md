# October exercise report
This month was half marathon month. I’ve done a half marathon at least once a year since 2015 so the streak officially continues. Much of the month was in prep for that, it was also in slightly [less warmer climes than running training in September](https://colinpattinson.github.io/exercise-2021-9/).

I look evil in the following image. I was at the finish line, don’t judge me.

## Context
Some days back in the North-East but mostly nice long runs around London on Sunday mornings with my running partner!

### Activities 
This is what I did…

#### What activities?
This month included:

<iframe title="Count of activity" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-8ZlE9" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8ZlE9/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="250"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

25 total activities in 31 days. Down from last month but I took a little bit of a break post half marathon as a treat so not so much of a shock.

#### Totals & averages
Exercising:
- total miles: 108.06 miles. Less cycling so number not massive. 
- in 2021 I have now racked up over 1510.57 miles. Over 1500 miles mark! Pretty cool.

Time:
- total time taken: 23 hours. Less total time. I like to think this is because I was running faster than before.
- average exercise time: 55 minutes, an increase but not by much. 

#### What else?
Facts and figures:
- longest distance was a 13.30 mile run. 
- lowest distance was a 2.39 mile walk 
- fastest run was at the 7 mins 50 secs per mile mark.

## Perspective
Have been investing a lot of time in growing tomatoes and herbs. I now have x3 greenhouses as I write this in November. I am very committed to this hobby.

## What next?
No big exercise events upcoming. More about racking up total miles before I see the end of this monthly reporting.
