# Theatre End Of Year Review
Last year I managed to go to [39 separate shows](https://colinpattinson.github.io/theatre-part-2-2024/). I aspired to actually go to less shows this year, partly because I sat in a few shows in previous years that were pants. So I was going for quality over quantity. Or that was the desire. Let's see if that’s how we fare. 

## Rankings
I can officially reveal I attended 32 shows in 2025 (with one show appearing twice!). Lets go from least good to best. This year I’m also going to try something new. Not reveal my scores from my mega theatre spreadsheet but I’ll tier them into grades: 
* D - a show you can miss
* C - passable enough
* B - great entertainment
* A - must see

**Jump to:** [D Grade](#d-grade-shows) | [C Grade](#c-grade-shows) | [B Grade](#b-grade-shows) | [A Grade](#a-grade-shows)

## D Grade shows
### 32) [Boys from the Blackstuff](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/boys-from-the-blackstuff/)
> Chrissie, Loggo, George, Dixie and Yosser are used to hard work and providing for their families. But there is no work and there is no money. What are they supposed to do? Work harder, work longer, buy cheaper, spend less? They just need a chance.

A review of the show reads ‘The audience hangs on every syllable’. I didn’t. It all seemed a bit miserable and cliche for my liking. It wasn’t awful. I’ve seen worse but I would have loved it to have impressed me more.

### 31) [Potty the Plant](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/potty-the-plant)
> A charmingly dark, whimsically adult, joyously subversive, musical delight! Starring our titular character, Potty! A singing, talking, tap dancing, potted plant. When mysterious events begin to occur at Little Boo Boo's General Hospital, a ragtag bunch of dysfunctional nurses must pull together to save the day. What could be happening to all the missing children? Will the beautiful Miss Lacey ever find true love? Is there more to the nasty-looking Dr Acula than meets the eye? Potty The Plant is an hour of side-splitting, earwormy, musical fun, that begs the audience to not take anything too seriously.

![Potty the plant flyer with reviews and the character of Potty](https://scontent-lhr8-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/515971590_713200708018260_6810238730032536691_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s1080x2048_tt6&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=833d8c&_nc_ohc=hsT1DeO2_9EQ7kNvwGw3mQk&_nc_oc=AdkzNKT0pDqiV6ps3kJA27jyOqQm5pTKJphhjnP4zmlYSx3aHm0Ghqfao9u9MCqvmFJ6gQPoB_AZ8ooI_jV7tpmr&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.xx&_nc_gid=SZ08O_lK92rGELoPmoYirA&oh=00_AfmfrrLODHIh-PBv-NsgDy5InNfVZCYpo-IgwJ23UFvhCQ&oe=694B1505)

An Edinburgh Fringe show. It seemed to have a very committed fan base of younger folk at the very front. For me, it was fine. Some of the jokes didn’t tickle me that much (e.g. a lot of ginger jokes) and I think it could have been even darker than what it was. Was sorta like a more adult panto. Not terrible. Could have been better.


### 30) [Matt Forde](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/matt-forde-defying-calamity)
> Leading political comedian Matt Forde (The Royal Variety Performance, Spitting Image, HIGNFY, British Scandal) finds positivity in life despite all the evidence to the contrary in politics and his own health.

Some of this was great and was very interesting/heart warming to see how he is overcoming his health issues. I remember the crowd being a bit fussy which might have detracted from the experience. 

### 29) [Picture you Dead](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/picture-you-dead/)
> DSI Grace investigates a cold case that leads him to the secretive world of fine art, but beneath the respectable veneer lurks a dark underworld of deception and murder. When one unsuspecting couple unearth a potentially priceless masterpiece, they discover that their dream find is about to turn into their worst nightmare, and only Grace can stop them from paying the ultimate price.

There was an older fella in the crowd who was very noticeably yawning throughout this performance. He was not even in the same part of the theatre as me. The whole crowd was quite quiet and didn’t seem to clap when you’d expect them too. Maybe a bigger % of the audience was just not feeling it and zoning out. 

I actually thought this was fine. A little by numbers but entertained me reasonably enough.

### 28) [Darkfield Radio](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/darkfield-radio-double-visitors-and-eternal)
> Award-winning 360-degree sound experiences, from the DARKFIELD Radio project. DOUBLE is a troubling exploration of the Capgras delusion, an uncommon condition in which the sufferer is convinced a loved one has been replaced by an evil replica. 

A mate of mine and I sat in a dark room, eyes closed, across from one another with headphones on and immersed ourselves in this. It was atmospheric more than good but was a nice palette cleanser on our little Edinburgh Fringe day out. 

## C Grade shows
### 27) [Entertaining Mr Sloane](https://www.youngvic.org/whats-on/entertaining-mr-sloane)
> When lonely Kath offers the mysterious Mr Sloane a room to rent in the family home, her businessman brother Ed does not approve. After all, what will people say? But soon, he becomes equally taken with the charismatic young Sloane. Only their old Dada remains wary, convinced that he recognises this stranger. What begins as a convenient living arrangement spirals into a dangerous game of desire and deceit.

![Entertaining Mr Sloane poster with three main characters in view](https://images.ctfassets.net/6pezt69ih962/57c1EEIxwUSyty624E45oB/6a6f12bae5744a1d3563a1d6596b141c/EMS_1600x1200.png)

I love the Young Vic. It’s got such a high rate of great shows. This one was just ok. I’ve mentioned crowds a few times already but this had some patrons that repeatedly kept on whipping their phones out (during the performance) and taking videos and pictures of the performers while they were undressing. I’ve not seen that type of behaviour before. Bit of a let down because it’s a bit hard to get into the show when you keep seeing phones light up a dark room. Might have affected my scoring sadly. 

### 26) [Champion](https://www.live.org.uk/whats-on/champion)
> Summer 1977. South Shields. Muhammad Ali is coming to town. Set during the great boxer’s now legendary visit to The North East this searing new drama shows the effect that such a major event has on a mixed race family in South Shields.

Nice little drama. I must have been at the preview because I had a guy next to me scribbling notes furiously only to later realise he was the creative director for the entire theatre. Wouldn’t say must see but solid.

### 25) [Adam Kay](https://northernstage.co.uk/whats-on/adam-kay/)
> Join BAFTA-winning writer and comedian Adam Kay for an evening of hilarious and horrifying anecdotes, as well as a unique insight in to the British healthcare system as he takes the audience behind the blood-splattered blue curtain. Adam will be joined in conversation by Nihal Arthanayake who will act as your guide throughout the evening as Adam launches his debut crime novel, A Particularly Nasty Case.

Unusual event for me. A sort of book tour/discussion rather than a show. The interviewer was very good and it was humorous. You got a book with the event (which I have not read yet but will!). It was both a bit staged (as you would imagine, some regular questions to sell the book) and scattergun (random questions and tidbits). Wouldn’t say no to another event like this again though.

### 24) [Murder on the Orient Express ](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/murder-on-the-orient-express/)
> Winter 1934 and an avalanche stops The Orient Express dead in its tracks. A murder. A train full of suspects. An impossible case. Trapped in the snow with a killer still on-board, can the world’s most famous detective, Hercule Poirot, crack the case before the train reaches its final destination?

![Murder on the Orient Express show with the train and characters in view](https://img.theatreroyal.co.uk/uploads/2024/04/Rebecca-Charles-Debbie-Chazen-Paul-Keating-Jean-Baptiste-Fillon-Michael-Maloney-Bob-Barrett-inMurder-on-the-Orient-Express.jpg?fit=1400%2C800)

In my notes I have a bit of a random collection of points. Apparently the theatre had a faint whiff of pee, the show was a tiny bit languid but I was very impressed by the staging of the moving parts of the train. From memory I thought the show was a nice slab of classic entertainment. Nothing to blow your socks off but worth the time.

### 23) [The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/the-lion-the-witch-and-the-wardrobe/)
> Step through the wardrobe into the magic kingdom of Narnia where a world of wonder awaits. Join Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter as they meet new friends, face dangerous foes and learn the lessons of courage, sacrifice, and the power of love. Celebrating the 75th anniversary of C.S. Lewis’ classic novel, watch The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe come to life in this spectacular production – a delight for all ages.

I took nieces to this show. It was a bit more scary and lavishly produced then I thought. The wolf type villain was definitely amazingly themed but could give you nightmares. Lion was also beautifully costumed. Some impressively abstract moments in there too. It’s a good show. 

### 22) [Rob Beckett ](https://www.getintonewcastle.co.uk/whats-on/o2-city-hall-newcastle/rob-beckett-giraffe)
> Rob Beckett brings his brand-new live show Giraffe to Newcastle's O2 City Hall this November, so if you're after a night of laughs then look no further!

Friend invited me to this. Was pleasantly surprised I chuckled as much as I did as I don’t really know much Rob Beckett stuff. Wouldn’t say a must see but I chuckled enough to make it a pleasant evening.

### 21) [Nish Kumar](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/nish-kumar-nish-don-t-kill-my-vibe)
> Following an election year – with the country in turmoil – there’s only one comedian who can kill the mood even further… Nish Kumar – one of The Guardian and The Telegraph’s 50 Best Comedians of the 21st Century – returns with his politically-charged stand-up show.

Saw on the same day as Matt Forde. Similar crowd to be honest. Laughed more at this though so higher up the list. He’s a frenetic comedian so it kept a good pace throughout. Friend went to the loo later on into the show though and the person at the end of the row refused to stand up and let them pass on their return. Which is nightmare fuel if the comedian had spotted, no idea why they wished to be so stubborn. Poor friend trapped in no man's land on the stairs unable to get back to his seat.  

### 20) [Hamlet Hail to the thief](https://factoryinternational.org/whats-on/hamlet-hail-to-the-thief/)
> A frenetic adaptation of Shakespeare’s Hamlet haunted by Radiohead’s Hail to the Thief Shakespeare’s great tragedy and Radiohead’s seminal album collide for a feverish experience that fuses theatre, music, and movement. In this frenetic distillation of Shakespeare's masterpiece, Elsinore has come under new rule and hectic runs in the blood of its citizens. Hamlet Hail to the Thief centres on Hamlet and Ophelia's awakening to the lies and corruption revealed by ghosts and music. Paranoia reigns and no one is spared a tragic unravelling. In this adaptation, music becomes an integral part of the narrative. Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke has reworked the band’s critically acclaimed album into a deconstructed score that illuminates the text and is performed by live musicians.

![Hamlet Hail To The Thief Poster](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0791/1961/4298/files/HamletHTTT-ManchesterA3Poster.png?v=1744638936)

Part of the Manchester International festival. Some amazing things about this was that the lead actor playing Hamlet was mesmirising. It turned out it's [the same guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Blenkin) that ended up being in the TV show Alien:Earth - bright future that guy. 
Then after popping to the pub for a post show drink. We saw the band come in which was nice but even better… we then saw Thom Yorke (of Radiohead fame) pop in and congratulate the band. Amazing. I didn’t bother him as he was having a nice moment but fun to see that post-show.

### 19) [Big Ange](https://www.live.org.uk/whats-on/big-ange)
> THE REVOLUTION WILL BE CATERED! In a forgotten town stitched together with broken bus shelters and fading murals of past glory, one woman wants to change everything. A teenage football squad charges through a world of projected noise — collapsing housing estates, Instagram hearts fluttering like confetti, graffiti glowing like prophecy. This is England, but skewed — off-balance, spinning. Blue jeans, a whistle, and a Neil Diamond playlist — Big Ange, the dinner lady has got this.

Preview show, which clearly needed a little bit more TLC but it had a lot of interesting parts about radicalisation, young men and family dynamics. Was interesting and produced some nice talking points in the pub after the show to muse on and unpick.

### 18) [Derren Brown: Only Human](https://www.atgtickets.com/shows/derren-brown-only-human/sunderland-empire/)
> Prepare to be astonished! The multi award-winning master of mind control and psychological illusion, Derren Brown, returns with his brand new live show, ONLY HUMAN.

Partner wasn’t very impressed but I enjoyed it. Apparently when you know the performer will get the answer right in the end, the thrill of him finding it out is diminished. I shouldn’t really give much away from what I enjoyed but some scenes were very impressive (person dying on stage - lets leave it at that). 

## B Grade shows
### 17) [Hunger Games On Stage](https://thehungergamesonstage.com/)
> Citizens of Panem. Prepare for an epic spectacle. The stage is set for the premiere of The Hunger Games: On Stage, now playing in London in a purpose-built, state-of-the-art venue: Troubadour Canary Wharf Theatre.

![Inside the Hunger Games theatre venue](https://thehungergamesonstage.com/app/uploads/2025/11/HGfullstage2025JP_00003-Editcrop-1-1.jpg)

I have another guilty pleasure of loving visiting new venues. So getting to check out London’s £26m newest theatre was always likely to appeal. The whole event felt a bit more like a show at a theme park (as you also have stands that literally move to accommodate the gargantuan set). That isn’t a critique, it’s a big blockbuster show. So I got what I wanted in that sense.

I had [read a review](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy9pw4jv31po) in advance that said "There's little emotional impact - we are watching children die and that should hit hard, but it doesn't" - I get that. It didn’t emotionally move me, more made me gawp at all the visuals.  

### 16) [Elis & John](https://www.tynetheatreandoperahouse.uk/whatson/elis-john-that-feels-significant-live/)
> Elis James, John Robins and Dave Masterman are hitting the road! How does that feel?! I’ll tell you how it feels… SIGNIFICANT! Yes! Britain’s youngest and most relevant podcast-first broadcasters are coming to a theatre near you, and this time they’re bringing Dave!

Their podcast has brought lots of joy over the years. I saw John Robins solo in 2023 and it was nice to see the whole gang. It was quite short but exactly the type of silliness I was in the mood for. One skit also led to me having to help John climb over the crowd to speak to another John. Fun times.  

### 15) [Ghost Stories](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/ghost-stories/)
> When Professor Goodman, arch-sceptic out to debunk the paranormal, embarks on an investigation of three apparent hauntings – as recounted by a night-watchman, a teenage boy, and a businessman awaiting his first child – Goodman finds himself at the outer limits of rationality, and fast running out of explanations.

An unexpected spectacle. I thought this could be bang average but it was a great night out. I am pretty sure they even pumped in some smells for some parts of the show which shows good commitment to the bit. I was sat right at the end of the row too so I was convinced in the scary moments someone would jump out and scare me which probably heightened every sense. 

### 14) [Birdsong](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/birdsong/)
> Sebastian Faulks’s epic story of love and loss returns to the stage marking the 30th anniversary of the international best-selling novel. The critically acclaimed show returns in a brand-new production. Telling the story of one man’s journey through an all-consuming love affair and into the horror of the First World War.

A real surprise. I didn’t know the original story and hadn’t appreciated how good it was at showing the madness of war. The love story is probably only about 33% of the show. I might have even shed a tear at one point.

### 13) [Inside No.9 Stage Fright](https://www.atgtickets.com/shows/inside-no-9-stage-fright/sunderland-empire/)
> Expect the unexpected as the acclaimed BBC TV series comes to life on stage, fresh from a sell out West End run, weaving its signature web of twisted tales and black humour. From the eerie to the absurd, the Olivier Award nominated smash hit Inside Number 9 - Stage/Fright combines comedy and horror with a dramatic script that will leave you guessing until the very end.

This is going to be a bit odd. As this was the second time I saw this show. The first time in London and the second up in the North. The second time, unsurprisingly for a mystery, was less thrilling so it got dinged a little. Regardless, it's still an excellent show. Mate & myself had done a 9 mile walk to get to the theatre (on purpose) and then I realised I had accidentally booked us on seats on the total opposite side of the theatre. Woops. 

### 12) [Stereophonic](https://www.thedukeofyorks.com/stereophonic)
> Plug into the electric atmosphere of an up-and-coming rock band recording their second album in 1976. The one that could propel them to superstardom. As the tape rolls, egos flare, relationships break down, tensions run high and something extraordinary takes shape. This is how great art is made. One take at a time.

![Flyer for Stereophonic play saying the most Tony nominated show of all time](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5d82284bd06ccc57c3a19ebc/677e6250a2f4170121e79a40_Stereophonic_Title_1920x1080.jpg)

I was well excited for this. I loved the music prior to seeing the show and the rave reviews from the States set my expectations super high. It was good/great but didn’t surpass my high bar. Perhaps a little longer than it needs to be and if anything they’d only do some snippets of songs when they music is so good you’d love to hear the full track. Still, I can see why it’s loved. If you like Fleetwood Mac then go see this. 

### 11) [Murder She Didn't Write](https://northernstage.co.uk/whats-on/murder-she-didnt-write/)
> Don your deerstalker, grab your magnifying glass and get your ‘finger of suspicion’ at the ready because Edinburgh Fringe favourites, Degrees of Error, are bringing back their multiple sell-out show for your sleuthing pleasure. They’ll create a classic murder mystery on-the-spot in this ingenious improvised comedy. You, the audience, become the author as the cast act out your very own Agatha Christie-inspired masterpiece live on stage. At each show this extraordinarily talented company use audience suggestions to create a unique, original and extremely comical murder mystery just for you. All you have to do… is solve it!

All improvised with our show having a lot about WW1 taxidermy. Had a significant amount of chuckles. It’s always joyful when you see the performers make each other laugh too. Thankfully I didn’t need to contribute any ideas but was very very very close to the person they picked. As they say… was in the splash zone.

### 10) [Dear England](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/dear-england/)
> It’s time to change the game. The country that gave the world football has since delivered a painful pattern of loss. The England men’s team has the worst track record for penalties in the world, and manager Gareth Southgate knows he needs to open his mind and face up to the years of hurt to take team and country back to the promised land.

Despite being about a football manager and football this operated a bit more like a ballet. The football scenes were very tastefully done and this should be much worse than what it is. It’s actually excellent. A lot of focus is about Pippa, the psychologist, and it can be quite funny and thrilling.  

## A Grade shows
### 9) [Miss Saigon](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/miss-saigon/)
> In the last days of the Vietnam War, 17 year-old Kim is forced to work in a Saigon bar run by a notorious character known as The Engineer. There she meets and falls in love with an American GI named Chris but they are torn apart by the fall of Saigon. For 3 years Kim goes on an epic journey of survival to find her way back to Chris, who has no idea he’s fathered a son.

![Miss Saigon scene with mother holding child and soldiers all around her](https://www.westendtheatre.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Miss-Saigon-UK-tour-Danny-Kaan.jpg)

This is the show I’d say we really start to pick up with a very strong recommendation to see. I didn’t really know anything about Miss Saigon before walking in. In fact I thought it was gonna be like the King & I. I was wrong. It’s full Vietnam war and has one of the greatest characters I’ve ever seen on stage… The Engineer. It has great songs and is a good production.

Our show did have a malfunction and apparently there was a helicopter prop that got shelved in our performance but honestly it was brilliant. 

### 8) [Hamilton](https://www.atgtickets.com/shows/hamilton/sunderland-empire/)
> This is the story of America's Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant from the West Indies who became George Washington's right-hand man during the Revolutionary War and helped shape the very foundations of the America we know today. The score blends hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap, R&B and Broadway - the story of America then, as told by America now.

I know, I know. I should have seen this by now but I hadn’t. Took me a while and you know what, I was a little apprehensive that the hype would make me disappointed when I finally saw it. Well, I absolutely see why it's a smash hit. Very very slick, great songs and performers. 
The older couple next me did walk out at the interval. My guess was they were expecting singing and not rapping so might have got a bit tired trying to follow the story. 

### 7) [The Book of Mormon](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/the-book-of-mormon-2/)
> It’s The Book of Mormon, the nine-time Tony Award and four-time Olivier winning Best Musical. This outrageous musical comedy from creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and Bobby Lopez co-writer of Avenue Q and Frozen, follows the misadventures of a mismatched pair of missionaries, sent on a mission to a place that’s about as far from Salt Lake City as you can get.

I’d seen this years ago. This time I went with some pals & partner. It’s still a blast. There were plenty of people all around us full on belly laughing. Still crude and ridiculous but if you like that then it’s a must see. 

### 6) [James Acaster](https://www.thestand.co.uk/performance/20485/james-acaster-work-in-progress/20251102/newcastle)
> James Acaster tries new ideas for a bit.

I’ve seen James Acaster a few times over the years but this was a tiny venue with pals as he did some work in progress stuff. It was unsurprisingly brilliant. Expertly layered, including whom he picked to be the warm up act. Seemed random at the start that he had a singer covering 70’s disco. Everyone looking around thinking is he going to tell a joke or just sing. Only for James to eventually come out and the theme of impersonators being core to the show.
Lots of laughs. Very funny fan interaction that nearly broke James. 

### 5) [Joe Kent-Walters](https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/joe-kent-walters-is-frankie-monroe-dead-good-fun-time)
> Yorkshire’s biggest bastard and Edinburgh Comedy Award Best Newcomer 2024 is back! This time he's dead… dead good! And also, dead. He's a dead man. Join the nation's favourite demonic Working Men's Club owner as he dazzles you from beyond the grave.

I wrote “grotesque” in my notes and I think that’s a good review. This show is chaotic, dark and an absolute blast. It’s choc-full of audience participation (so find a dark corner if you hate that). It was thrilling and set in a basement (which is a good setting for a character escaping hell). I shall see him again next year on tour with a different pal and hopefully you’ll see his name high up again in my 2026 list. 

### 4) [Shucked](https://openairtheatre.com/production/shucked)
> Tony Award-winning musical comedy Shucked makes its much-anticipated UK premiere, landing at Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre for 5 weeks only, following an acclaimed run on Broadway and a US tour. Maizy and Beau are getting hitched, when the corn that protects their small community starts to die. The town needs answers. But who will dare to venture beyond the borders of Cob County?

![Regents Park Open Air Theatre with Shucked being performed](https://www.whatsonstage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/Shucked-2.jpg?w=640)

Never saw a show at Regents Park Open Air Theatre before and it's absolutely beautiful. You should go if you get the chance! Show was also a real surprise. This was full of corn puns and was sweet & silly. Really happy to see it and couldn’t think of a better place to see it (outdoors!). Only thing is it can get nippy when dark. So bring some extra layers. 

### 3) [Carousel: A Theatre Show by Ivo Graham](https://northernstage.co.uk/whats-on/carousel/)
> Ivo Graham, who has watched this Mad Men clip approximately 100 times, steps away from the frivolity of his stand-up and invites you into his own carousel: around and around, backwards and forwards, to the places he aches to go again. A searingly direct, exquisitely sound tracked story of a life: good luck at your next meeting.

![Ivo Graham with microphone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Ivo_Graham_-_Secret_Comedy_Podcast_-_4_August_2013_-_15_%289435791299%29.jpg/1600px-Ivo_Graham_-_Secret_Comedy_Podcast_-_4_August_2013_-_15_%289435791299%29.jpg?20191031142955)

Eviscerating, beautiful and sad. I believe I cried. It still had some humour but the show unravelled and shared his past with searing honesty. I’m not sure he’ll perform this again but it was very cathartic. I was extremely impressed. Any usual year, this would be my top show.

### 2) [Inside No. 9 Stage/Fright](https://www.wyndhamstheatre.co.uk/whats-on/inside-no-9-stage-fright)
> Familiar characters and stories will mix with brand new material by the genius of creators Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who will also perform in the production, as they bring their unique brand of storytelling to the West End for a strictly limited season.

… and here it is again. I saw the first run in London and it blew me away with the humour and inventiveness. Full of twists and turns and [every show has a special guest](https://www.reddit.com/r/insideno9/comments/1i615t6/stagefright_january_discussion_thread_spoilers/). For this one I got Rob Brydon who was very funny too. 
I like the show, I like League of Gentlemen & I like theatre so it’s probably no surprise I loved this.

### 1) [Public Record](https://www.thefirestation.org.uk/whats-on/sunderland-culture-sunderland-empire-and-national-theatre-present-public-record-8vds)
> A community comes together to record an album. To make a record of who they are, what they’re about, where they’ve come from and where they want to go. It’s about life and loss, memory and love, the things we choose to remember, the ways we choose to let go. There will be music and dancing, karaoke and DJs, a knockout house band and a massive disco ball. This is Sunderland writing its own history. It’s a celebration of everything we are. And everyone’s invited. Featuring music from The Futureheads’ Ross Millard, an incredible line up of local legends from Sunderland’s music scene, professional dancers and community groups, this explosive new show from Public Acts brings together a cast of over a hundred people to lift the roof off The Fire Station with the sound of Sunderland.

![Poster for Public Record](https://img.thefirestation.org.uk/1z1IsTiXC6_ZKPcMcmd8z27ljtmnTo4WktZLQfSCs9w/c:4500:4500/s:900:900:1/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZmlyZXN0YXRpb24ub3JnLnVrLy9jbXNfZmlsZXMvc3lzdGVtL2ltYWdlcy9pbWcxMDUyX29yaWcuanBn)

Here we are. Top of the tree. What a brilliant, beautiful surprise this was.

It was part of the Public Acts programme - the National Theatre’s nationwide programme creating extraordinary acts of theatre and community. Only on for 3 days. It had over 100 performers (kids, professionals, novices,  young, old, migrant, local, etc). Recorded and will be kept in a museum to commemorate the event. One of the most beautiful moments which requires such foresight is that it tried to record the oldest and youngest person in the city on that very day. So much so, they had a recorded video for the oldest but also recorded the first cries of a newborn baby from that morning. So many feels.

Not sure how to summarise but it was remarkably human from all angles. All the sadness and joy and was a total utter triumph that I had no clue it would be as good as it was. It ascends to the pantheon of being in the top 2 shows I’ve ever seen.

## Review
Last year I had an average score of 80.2%. Well, ladies and gentlemen… we beat the average. This year was *81.3%*. I had 9 shows above 90%. Which is incredible. So many great shows. My plan was to see less but better and you know what. I think I achieved it!! 

I should give a shoutout to the new theatres and venues I saw this year too. Regents Park Open Air probably the winner. Might see what’s on this year to see if I can relive the joy!

#### What is next?
As always… I’ve got some stuff locked up for 2026 already. I’m excited for:
* [High Noon](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/sep/15/high-noon-west-end-billy-crudup-gary-cooper-harold-pinter-theatre) - never seen it before. Sounds very intriguing and up my alley.
* [Oh Mary](https://ohmaryplay.co.uk/) - another very American based show but got rave reviews in the U.S. and could be a right hoot. 
* [Operation Mincement](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/operation-mincemeat/) - could be fun. I read the book years ago and was a blast so could make for a great show!

Excellent year. 2026 has a lot to live up too!
