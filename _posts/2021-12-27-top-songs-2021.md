I made myself some festive gin and tonics and I cranked out a best of 2021 playlist and have the urge to share.

Rules: these are not all released in 2021. In fact one was released in 1936. If it‚Äôs 85 years old‚Ä¶ we can call that a deep cut. 

# Playlist
And here we gooooooo‚Ä¶

## Portico Quartet - Opening
Great modern jazz band. Create beautiful atmospheric music. Good music while working. 

A long time ago I saw them  play in the Science Museum to accompany an exhibit at the sun. There I bumped into [a product legend and mentor](https://twitter.com/lisa_e_scott) and had a thoroughly great time.

## Turnstile - Mystery
Late entry this one. Only got into them in December. Now booked times to see them. Remind me a bit of PUP and with sprinklings of nu-metal. Absolute banger of an album. Quite the mix of styles‚Ä¶ this is heavy but almost dancey.

## Megan Thee Stallion - Thot Shit
Bit of a swerve. I mean the song is probably very NSFW but it‚Äôs got so much attitude how could I not love it.

## Tion Wayne - Body (Remix)
Party still going with this one. I admire a song that can crowbar a super soaker reference in there.

## Little Simz - Point and Kill
Amazing album and artist. Up there as one of the best and so many great songs to choose from but had to pick one. 

## Lil Nas X - INDUSTRY BABY
Partly this song reminds me of the time this year I went out with two heroes from work and we were having too much fun. Which led to lots of wine and cheese. Walked home in the rain blasting this all the while knowing I had an interview the next morning.

Enjoyed the defiance of;
> You was never really rootin' for me anyway (like, ooh-ooh)
When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say (like, ooh-ooh)
He don't run from nothin', dog
Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over

## Royal Blood - Typhoons
Earlier this year I desperately needed to get away. I went up to Inverness solo and rented a bike and had a very lovely time nipping down to Loch Ness. This song became stuck in my head on the radio. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cycled to Loch Ness. Extremely happy with this choice. <a href="https://t.co/WFUleqoUYF">pic.twitter.com/WFUleqoUYF</a></p>&mdash; Colin Pattinson (@ColinPattinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/1399346161320927233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Everytime I Die - Thing With Feathers
Bit more sombre this one. Excellent band, always consistent. On the heavier end of the spectrum. This song has the singer of Manchester Orchestra featuring on it. He (according to Spotify) has been in pretty much every top list I have from music played this year. 

## USERx - Headsick
Very much rooted in the early part of the year. Tough sledding those months and had yet more Manchester Orchestra (who feature on another song) to guide me through. The name of the band always remind me of UX and make me think of user experience as a profession. I have no idea why they picked that name. 

## Sam Fender - Seventeen Going Under
Maybe it sounds like a cheaper version of Bruce Springsteen but what can I say‚Ä¶ I like it. As a child of the North-East it speaks to me. Makes me feel like I am over on a South Shields beach, brings me memories of being in the local social club as a teen.

## Manchester Orchestra - Telepath (Remix)
Here they are again. I went for a more recent remix version though. Love a bit of xylophone and the ending of the song has a heartbreaking beauty about it.

## Taylor Swift - I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor‚Äôs version)
Taylor Swift re-recording all over her old music to reclaim it from those that ‚Äúown‚Äù it is very very interesting. I think it‚Äôs really incredible and I‚Äôve not been a big Taylor Swift fan but I really enjoyed this ‚ÄòRed‚Äô album. 

## Bleachers - How Dare You Want More
Credit for this is not with me. I learned this from a lady I met during 2021. I‚Äôd never really listened to Bleachers but they have some connection to The Format (a band I love). Amazing ending to this song. 

## Shubh Saran - Enculture
Back to the modern jazz. Very prog rock interlude. Excellent breakdowns in this track. Makes me both want to dance and rock out.

## Jimmy Eat World - Night Drive
Another band re-recording their own songs (likely for different motives this time). Enjoyed running to this throwback album. 

## Olivia Rodrigo - deja vu
Another one from the Inverness archives. The topic of this song I could relate to earlier in the year. 

## Be More Chill - Michael in the Bathroom
OK musical time. [Voted my 2nd favourite theatre show last year](https://colinpattinson.github.io/theatre-review-2021/). A total surprise at how much I enjoyed it. This song clearly means a lot to people though as even before the show started I [saw loads of people wearing an outfit](https://store.bemorechillmusical.com/big-creeps-long-sleeve-t-shirt-g-6.html) that has been entwined with this song.  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üèÜ Best theatre production I&#39;ve seen since 2019.

## Elton John - It‚Äôs a sin
Beautiful tune and total pop classic. I think I first saw [this rendition as part of an award show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk4eMIswunQ). 

## Bo Burnham - Goodbye
Loved ‚ÄòInside‚Äô and couldn‚Äôt not include one of the tracks. This is a fitting penultimate song. It‚Äôs so etched in COVID times.

## Paul Robeson - Ol‚ÄôMan River
This might need some explaining. I listened to a great episode of the [fab podcast ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre Dead To Me‚Äô which was all about the life of Paul Robeson](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p09ymr91). He had such an interesting life and I remember I was on a coach back to London listening to his music after the episode as the sun went down. Incredibly moving song!
