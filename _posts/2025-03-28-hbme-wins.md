I have previously written on [wins before](https://colinpattinson.github.io/Kry-Wins/) and today I am going to give it another go. This edition is about my time so far with Holland & Barrett, especially our offshoot of H&B&Me. It’s a good exercise in being reflective so indulge me a little. 

# Testing
When I first joined the company I was tasked with looking after the existing blood testing service that was in operation. There was a solid foundation but the service was still fairly new and the organisation had its eyes on more growth.

## Increase sales
First on the to do list was to increase sales. There were a few ways we could affect this which included working on better actual content to sell the tests (give a clearer articulation of what you can get if you do the test), altering the website itself to make it easier to actually buy tests, make the website perform better and make it more accessible so we perform even better when people search for blood tests alongside fiddling with different marketing techniques. We also ended up adding new tests where we thought there were gaps in the market for and introduced some new products. We even got tests into physical H&B stores too in the latter part of 2023 to see if we could bump sales with them being available in more locations.

This led to a record sales month within the org and consistently growing sales month by month.

## Increase NPS
As an org we tracked Net Promoter Score and when I joined we were in minus. We knew that improving the entire end to end service could aid more sales and more returning customers. There were some recurring themes from the qualitative feedback and one of the big ones was that it was very difficult to actually draw blood. Not a big shock but in an effort to prioritise the most impactful issues we did set to improving the guidance to users on what they should do to help getting getting the blood drawn as painlessly as possible. We looked into the instructions and looked into better linking to a video to show exactly what steps could aid the process. 

Along with a bunch of other smaller changes we managed to increase the net promoter score of the service 300%. Yes, 300 not 30. 

As 2023 came to a close we got word from management that we were going to try expand our offer wider than blood tests and had secured the funding to do so. The bet was to build a broader wellbeing/behaviour change proposition of which testing would be one component. This led to re-brand time!

# Releasing a new app / re-brand
As [this new app]("https://player.vimeo.com/video/958438672) was coming into fruition I  had a few tasks to help it emerge. During a lot of that we had not only reframing the features and experiences from the previous testing business into this new one but we had a big load of physical tests to refresh the brand for. I had some amazing colleagues who worked with a wide array of folk to pull off all the digital and physical changes we needed to make. We explained the entire switch over of brands to existing customers and what would happen to their data and did this in advance of the deadline.

Alongside that work I was aiding the actual release with helping to onboard new colleagues into how the app worked, supporting other colleagues with assessing other proposed features, getting all the app store releases sorted for launch day and it’s pretty remarkable how quickly we worked from getting the idea kicked off in late November/early December time and the first version released to the public in April. Some of the fastest work I’ve seen in the product world with the amount of features we had and set within a bigger corporate organisation!

A few months later I was also tasked with launching our first articulation of our B2B offer which was very fun. Trying to craft how we would attract a new type of audience and help build leads so we could help sell to them in the future. 

# Behaviour change team
2024 saw myself forming a new team that was focused on increasing the amount of behaviour change our service could achieve. In essence how could we maximise, through the app experience, people making committed changes to being healthier and happier.
Cool task. Lots of routes you could go down!

## Challenges, habits and goals
One of the first features we released was adding a ‘challenges’ feature. There is some evidence around competitiveness playing a factor in behaviour change (for some!) and we released a feature that meant you could compete with other users in something, say a walking challenge for a month. This had some good stats which saw us beat our benchmark participation rate each month since release. 

To help people find these challenges and also existing goals (say do yoga x3 a week) we introduced a new flow when you joined the app to get from signing up and being handholded into doing actions we thought would aid their behaviour change (so joining a new goal for example). We saw that over 35% of people who began the flow did indeed sign up for a goal or challenge and it eventually led to higher participation overall. 

## Points and Rewards
One of the biggest features and with some of the most astounding stats was Points and Rewards. This work had to involve a lot of people (given the commercial aspect of rewards) but super rewarding. Points and rewards obviously can be helpful to motivate people to do actions that we think promote behaviour change and we released a small pilot to see if our bets in this space would pay off. The results were incredible. We saw:
- x4 more people start goals if points and rewards on offer vs. control
- Those on pilot more than x22 more likely to complete a goal compared to control group
- Those on the pilot read more articles (x9 more), watched more videos and interacted with the coach (x17) more 
- Those on the pilot join more challenges (x7 more than those in the control group)
- Over x4 as many users stick around for consecutive months vs control (retention) 

Some of the best stats I’ve ever seen as of the result of a sole feature/experience. Naturally this feature is going to rolled out to more after we reflected on the above results.

## Credibility
One user problem that we address was in around credibility of the offer. We saw from user comments that some users at first didn’t perceive the biological age score we presented them with after a first round of questions could be accurate enough. It’s a fine balance between giving users too many questions to the detriment of them getting through the flow vs having enough questions to give an accurate score. After tweaking bits and bobs to up how science-y the bio age felt we also added some extra questions and fixed some of them that were not working as we expected from launch. 

All the tweaks culminated in us lowering the amount of people who reported that we were producing an “inaccurate” biological age for them. We got it down by 27.27% from July to October, basically meaning more people thought what we were presenting felt more accurate. 

## Spotlights
To help give a showcase to things like excellent content, news or new challenges/goals (which all could help you be happier and healthier if you consumed them) we introduced a ‘spotlight’ feature. This has been a useful tool in helping to get users into other parts of the app by signposting them there. We have about an 80% to 84% engagement rate with them month by month.  

## Manual updates
Knowing we might need more ways for users to also affect their bio age we have been adding more manual ways to input info about yourself. For example we can ask people their waist circumference or their blood pressure or even results from a cholesterol blood test and all can affect your bio age. So we wanted ways people could tell us more to give them hopefully a more representative biological age and one day signpost where they might be best on focusing. We need to review the feature soon to double check how it's performing!

## A sample of other stuff we’ve been doing
Other bits and bobs:
- enhanced content variety: Introducing more diverse content like images in coach messages and videos (landscape and portrait) for articles and messages, featuring engaging topics like recipes and yoga classes.
- coach enhancements: Exploring practical improvements and ambitious ideas to make the coach more effective and engaging.
- dynamic content updates: Adding varied formats and placements for content across the app to keep it fresh and engaging.
- bug fixes & performance: Improved app stability with a higher crash-free rate after addressing long-standing bugs.
- better reminders & goal planning: Developing smarter ways for users to set reminders, plan actions, and achieve goals.
- predictive insights: Exploring features to predict outcomes (e.g., how actions impact biological age) and recommend personalized strategies.
- innovative health data input: Considering advanced methods for users to input health data beyond manual entry.
- behavioral change focus: Applying evidence-based behavioral change techniques (e.g., action planning) to drive habit formation and improve interventions.

# Outcomes
So did all these changes have much of an effect?

As I write this it was just announced we won the [​​Customer Experience Game Changer award](https://awards.retail-week.com/live/en/page/winners-2025) at the Retail Week Awards 2025 when up against a ton of other big brands such as John Lewis and Sweaty Betty. Quite validating for everyone’s hard work over the past few months. 

But I think the short answer is yes regardless of the award. The stats are darn impressive for habit change alone. Where we’ve seen average overall improvements in participant health behaviours of within 9 weeks of app usage. Or nearly 9/10 users felt the app helped them build healthier habits, and over 75% said it helped them sustain those habits. The majority feeling the goals feature benefitted their overall health & wellbeing too. All very encouraging from the early data we see internally. 

We have seen app usage go consistently upwards since launch which is very cool, recently we’ve introduced subscriptions (another peer did that) which will affect numbers we suspect but we shall circle back to see what effect it had soon. 

In terms of user satisfaction too the new app has seen an increase in NPS scores over the past few months of around 80% which is a good signal we are on the right path.

# Team stuff
In addition to releasing new content, I've been working on several initiatives to enhance collective delivery. These include:
- serving as a representative for staff feedback and surveys.
- hosting weekly/monthly catch-ups and retrospectives to improve communication.
- organising fortnightly lean coffee sessions to address issues and celebrate successes.
- implementing product-focused workflows like briefs, roadmaps, and user research.
- creating videos to promote shared understanding and asynchronous work.
- publishing weekly updates in Slack to keep colleagues informed.

# What’s next

We have loads of exciting things on the roadmap to sink our teeth into as we blast further into 2025. My personal objectives are continuing to get people healthier and happier and keeping a great atmosphere within the team to relentlessly release amazing experiences.
