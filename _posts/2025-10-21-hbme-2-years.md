# Six Months of Impact: Building Momentum with H&B&Me

Over the past six months at Holland & Barrett, I’ve had the privilege of helping grow and evolve **H&B&Me**, our wellness behaviour change app that helps users add quality years to their lives. As I mark my **second anniversary** here, I wanted to share some of the latest wins, lessons, and reflections from our team. A [follow up to my previous post](https://colinpattinson.github.io/hbme-wins/). 

This is also a personal checkpoint — a moment to take stock of what I’ve achieved helping to guide the team through a sometimes turbulent scale-up environment. We’ve had a strong push to move fast and show results and I think we’ve done a splendid job in that regard. We’ve been trying to up engagement, retention, user satisfaction, credibility and lastly checking if we are making a meaningful impact to make a users life healthier and happier.

## Action Planning: Turning Goals Into Commitments

We’ve been exploring new [behaviour change techniques](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35995541/) to help users turn intention into action. One that stood out is **Action Planning**, which [helps people commit](https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/commitment/) to specific goals by declaring when they’d like to fit them into their schedules and the duration of the activity..

A few months ago we launched a new feature allowing users to declare when and how often they’ll complete a goal — and sync it automatically with their calendar. For example, a user might commit to swimming three times a week at chosen times, receiving reminders and motivational nudges to complete the activity both in-app and via their chosen native calendar of choice.

**Impact:** Completion rates rose by **8.6%** among users with action plans, and early exits from goals dropped noticeably. It proves that you can utilise science backed techniques to achieve measurable impact on user success and wellbeing.

## Face Scanning: First to Market with a Medical-Grade Innovation

![A screenshot of a male using a face scanning feature](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/facescanning.png?raw=true)

We partnered with a cutting-edge health tech provider to bring **facial scanning for blood pressure and heart rate** to H&B&Me, marking us as **the first client live** with their Class II medical device product.

The challenge was two-fold: balancing regulatory requirements with smooth UX, and educating users to trust the service rather than believe it was “magic” (literal user comment we had in early prototyping!). To counter this we created more explanations on how face scanning worked and rethought the flow. We also tied the scan results back into our **biological age** to create a compelling feedback loop on why to scan.

**Results:**
- 1 in 5 active users tried the feature within the first few weeks
- Nearly **50%** returned for repeat scans  
- App Store feedback praised its accuracy and personal impact

It’s exciting to be first to market and to see genuine user delight that could aid engagement and retention.

## Insights: Making Health Data Meaningful

With multiple new data points — from face scans to blood tests — it was clear we needed a unified home for user health tracking. We created an **Insights Tab**, consolidating results and self-monitoring tools into one place.

This was the first step toward a longer-term vision: moving towards a feed where users can track, compare, and act on their wellness data using intelligent prompts and trend insights. This would play on the [behavioural change technique](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/self-monitoring) of **self-monitoring**.

The work required rallying multiple internal teams around a shared vision, but it’s laid the foundation for a scalable, data-centric experience that users can actually monitor their health.

## New Partnership: Randox and a Reimagined Blood Test Journey

We refreshed H&B&Me’s blood testing service in the wake of a [growing partnership](https://styleofthecitymag.co.uk/randox-health-launches-new-clinic-inside-holland-barretts-cardiff-experience-store/) with **Randox**, integrating an improved selection of tests and a full app-to-lab-to-results journey.  

The redesign includes clear guidance, progress tracking, and upcoming integrations linking test results directly to each user’s biological age — closing the loop between offline diagnostics and digital wellness.

We hope to launch soon.

## Driving Health Integration Engagement

One challenge was improving how many users connected their app to **Apple Health, Google Fit, or Fitbit**. These integrations unlock richer insights, expanded access to more goals & challenges and daily biological age updates.  

We did an ideation session with a bunch of ideas on how might we increase the % of users with an active health integration. One idea we shipped early was improved communication during onboarding as to why it was beneficial to connect. We’re currently adding reminders for users who skipped connection the first time and we’ve been progressing pitching to move to Google Health Connect too.

**Results:** Between July and September, connected users increased by **70%**, reducing the gap that 52% of users didn’t have a connected health integration and that’s now only 19%. A simple but powerful shift in driving deeper engagement and retention.

## Strengthening Credibility and Trust

Trust is the currency of health tech. Over recent months we’ve worked to address credibility issues, including recalibrating unrealistic biological ages and introducing caps to maintain accuracy.

We also achieved **ORCHA accreditation**, verifying H&B&Me’s reliability and safety — a badge we’re proud to share with users. Since rollout, mentions of “unreliable bio ages” in NPS feedback have dropped to zero, and trust indicators have risen steadily.

## Quick Wins and Continuous Improvement

It’s been a rapid six months. A few other highlights include:
- New entry routes to update biological age, driving **19% more user updates**  
- Video content, including yoga and meditation sessions, receiving consistently positive feedback  
- A discovery into **Team Challenges**, which may help our B2B offer  
- Smarter personalisation in content and recommendations, for example avoiding showing recipes that don’t sit well with allergies you may have

## Outcomes and Impact

Against our key measures, here’s where we’ve landed:

| Goal | Outcome |
|------|----------|
| Drive engagement | **Record active user numbers** and an **8.9× increase** in weekly engagement since launch |
| Retention | DAU/MAU ratio grew **130%** year-on-year, now exceeding 20% — strong for a wellness app |
| User satisfaction | **+70 point positive swing** in NPS, surpassing the [34+ benchmark typical in health apps](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/) |
| Credibility | Significant reported trustworthiness increase validated via NPS and feedback & within a survey on credibility |
| Behaviour change | Widespread adoption of new techniques like Action Planning |
| Impact on wellbeing | Users with *good to excellent* health scores now form the majority, with both men and women’s average health score improving over the last year & self-reported behaviour change showing as being very positive - showing we are making a difference |

## Reflection

It’s been an extraordinary period of growth. Not everything comes easy and we’ve knuckled down a fair bit to get the results we have. We’ve had to learn how to keep noise at a manageable level so that we can deliver effectively and we’ve needed to communicate well upwards. We’ve learned to adopt more behavioural change and behavioral economics techniques to make science backed bets and considered credibility at the core of every key product decision. We’ve partnered deeply with science, legal and regs colleagues to make sure what we ship is safe and secure. We’ve adopted more ‘[how might we](https://makeiterate.com/how-to-run-how-might-we-workshops-a-quick-guide/)’ ideation sessions to tackle broader issues rather than be a mere feature factory. 

Alongside the challenges though we’ve had great fun! We’ve built something that genuinely helps people live healthier, happier lives — and that’s an amazing feeling. It’s really invigorating to be able to work hard but also see real outcomes and a whole gaggle of folk should feel great pride in the work they’ve done.
