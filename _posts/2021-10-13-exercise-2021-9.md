# September exercise report
I spent nearly half of my September over in wonderful Portugal (tail [end of August too](https://colinpattinson.github.io/exercise-2021-8/)). So lots of exercising sorta happened in & around exploring. I hadnâ€™t been off the UK for over 18 months so felt incredible to be out on an adventure again.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Adeus ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹. Had a fabulous time. Loved the port, enjoyed the train adventures, loved the running in sunshine and learning about your past. We shall meet again. <a href="https://t.co/059j64Z4BG">pic.twitter.com/059j64Z4BG</a></p>&mdash; Colin Pattinson (@ColinPattinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/1437381829955407872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

## Context
I didnâ€™t really count walks around Portugal in this although they obviously are exercise-like. I did many steps but kinda in spurts so did not meet my original criteria. Arguably these numbers are a bit lower than reality.

### Activities 
This is what I didâ€¦

#### What activities?
This month included:

<iframe title="Count of activities" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-slldp" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/slldp/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="304"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

36 total activities in 30 days. Down from last month but that was a banner month. More than 1 activity per day ainâ€™t terrible.

#### Totals & averages
Exercising:
- total miles: 129.36 miles. Less than the 231.58 miles last month but far less cycling which inflates the number. 
- in 2021 I have now racked up over 1402.51 miles.

Time:
- total time taken: 32 hours. Down 4 hours from last month. Let's say that 4 hours was off exploring
- average exercise time: 53 minutes, not far off last monthâ€™s 56 minutes.

#### What else?
Facts and figures:
- longest distance was a 12.65 mile run. Not far off the distance needed for upcoming half marathon 
- lowest distance was a 2.05 mile walk 
- fastest run was at the 8 mins per mile mark. Acceptable.

## Perspective
So energising to be away. Not all of 2020-21 has been tippity top so very very very wonderful to be away.

## What next?
Half marathon happens in October.
