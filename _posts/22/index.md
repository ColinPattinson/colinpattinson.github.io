# Weeknotes E07
Hi, I’m Colin a product manager working at the Department of Health and Social Care. Each week I’m going to keep a running update of the work I’ve done & things I’ve learned along the way.

P. S. We have vacancies! Come join the gang as a [Product Manager](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/index.cgi?SID=cGFnZWNsYXNzPUpvYnMmc2VhcmNoX3NsaWNlX2N1cnJlbnQ9MSZ1c2Vyc2VhcmNoY29udGV4dD01OTYxNTc1MSZwYWdlYWN0aW9uPXZpZXd2YWNieWpvYmxpc3QmY3NvdXJjZT1jc3FzZWFyY2gmb3duZXI9NTA3MDAwMCZqb2JsaXN0X3ZpZXdfdmFjPTE1ODg4ODkmb3duZXJ0eXBlPWZhaXImcmVxc2lnPTE1MzA3NDI2MzQtZGIyNzRhNWYyNzI5MWU3YjAwNzNmYWFlYTUxOTY3NzYwMTEyNzhhNg==) or [User Researcher](https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/index.cgi?SID=cGFnZWFjdGlvbj12aWV3dmFjYnlqb2JsaXN0JnVzZXJzZWFyY2hjb250ZXh0PTU5NjE1NzUxJnNlYXJjaF9zbGljZV9jdXJyZW50PTEmcGFnZWNsYXNzPUpvYnMmb3duZXJ0eXBlPWZhaXImam9ibGlzdF92aWV3X3ZhYz0xNTg4ODkwJmNzb3VyY2U9Y3Nxc2VhcmNoJm93bmVyPTUwNzAwMDAmcmVxc2lnPTE1MzA3NDI2MzQtZGIyNzRhNWYyNzI5MWU3YjAwNzNmYWFlYTUxOTY3NzYwMTEyNzhhNg==)!

## My current priority:
> Talk to teams who have requested help & see which is the most valuable and viable to help first.

## Wednesday
- To kick off the week Jeremy Hunt gave a speech about patient care. References to CQC, real people that had affected him, airline pilots and overall if you don’t measure it then things are harder to change.
- I prepped for a session I was running for the intranet team
- continued to set up more chats with teams requesting help
- listened into a call about a new commission website
- ran the intranet workshop and did some follow up emails asking for feedback and other resources. Slides here and will write up a blog eventually...
- team had a Quarter 2 review
- product people event admin
- Heard this quote for the first time… “Being President is like being the groundskeeper in a cemetery: there are a lot of people under you, but none of them are listening.”― Bill Clinton

## Thursday
- met previous colleague [Jamie](https://twitter.com/oddtype?lang=en) for a catch up over flat whites.

- chatting strategy and adult social care data with [Alice](https://twitter.com/aliceainsworth?lang=en). Also drew a rather funny looking map of the problem. Lots of lines.

## What I've been reading
1. World cup special… well sort of… long-read about [how the US missed out on the world cup and the years of rot](https://www.theringer.com/2018/6/5/17428184/2018-world-cup-us-soccer-inside-story-jurgen-klinsmann-sunil-gulati-bruce-arena) that made them miss the big tournament.
You’ve been [eating insects for a long time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43786055). I can imagine we’ll need to eat more over the next few centuries.
2. The [data trail we leave every minute, every day](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/#90f448e60ba9). BIG NUMBERS!
3. [GDS trying to create service communities](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/01/08/how-cross-government-communities-can-support-cross-government-services/). Challenges to create but feels like a good idea.
4. Should we [have a role in our multidisciplinary teams that focuses on ethics](https://medium.com/@alixtrot/working-ethically-at-speed-4534358e7eed) that coordinates creating ethical products 
5. Why [digital transformations fail](https://blog.wearefuturegov.com/teaching-the-world-to-sing-in-perfect-harmony-or-why-your-transformation-programme-will-fail-ea69fecf1f3a). Good to see communities of practice getting a shout out as something positive - we have one in health! Get in touch to join!
6. Some of the [forgotten building blocks of the web](https://anildash.com/2018/03/22/he-missing-building-blocks-of-the-web/) and the state they are in now.
7. [15 principles of a good service/service design](https://blog.louisedowne.com/2018/06/14/15-principles-of-good-service-design/). Will keep in mind for future work.
8. Evolution of the [gun emoji](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17278902/google-dumping-pistol-emoji-watergun-microsoft)
