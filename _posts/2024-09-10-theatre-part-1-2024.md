# Theatre Mid-Year Review
Here we go again. I’ve done this a few times over the past few years. The [2023 edition](https://colinpattinson.github.io/theatre-2023/) saw me visit 34 shows over 12 months. By the end of June I had seen 19 shows. Sadly 1 was missed due to a bout of covid. So I’m on course for another silly amount of theatre visits. It is probably classed as a vice at this point.

Rankings for the first part of 2024…

## Rankings

### 19) [The Syndicate](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/the-syndicate/)
> The Syndicate is a new stage play by Kay Mellor that follows five supermarket employees whose lottery syndicate numbers come in, just as their jobs and livelihoods are under threat

I don’t want to be mean but it was cack. Everything in the plot was so telegraphed I think my mind had already written a sequel to it 9 minutes into it. The acting was the worst I’ve seen in a while, much worse than some of the amateur productions I’ve seen. Not offensive in terms of topic or plot, just bad.

### 18) [Grease](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/grease-2/)
> After a whirlwind summer romance, leather-clad greaser Danny and girl-next-door Sandy are unexpectedly reunited when she transfers to Rydell High for senior year. But can they survive the trials and tribulations of teenage life and find true love once more?

This is going to sound unfathomable but I couldn’t work out what was happening in this. Yes, I know. It’s Grease. Like the movie, which I’ve seen. They seemed to have bungled the production so bad I wasn’t even sure where I was anymore with the characters. My single word review for it in my notes was “mess”.

This did have a drunk lady who kicked off and spilt drinks down the backs of people then threatened to start a fight with the theatre staff for having the gall to tell her to quieten down. She clearly didn’t love this show either.

### 17) [Cluedo 2](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/cluedo-2-the-next-chapter/)
> Set in the swinging 1960s, Cluedo 2, is a brand new tale, with a new house, new suspects, and a lot of new bodies! 

I hadn’t seen Cluedo 1 to be fair but it wasn’t funny. It was supposed to be funny. I wrote down it was lacklustre and that it had an odd dance scene (not in a positive sense). Credit though, I think some of the crowd liked it and the actors playing the police man and the cook were good.

### 16) [Gamble](https://northernstage.co.uk/whats-on/gamble-2/)
> Gamble is a glittering, glamorous peek into the spectacular world of online gambling. A bittersweet multimedia show about addiction and its effect on families, friends and communities.

Heartfelt but disjointed. Wanted to like it more. Deaf lady in the show was brilliant. 

### 15) [Frankenstein](https://northernstage.co.uk/whats-on/frankenstein/)
> Inspired by Mary Shelley’s novel. Remember, that I am thy creature; l ought to be thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel… A storm gathers outside. In an ordinary home, the lights flicker, a radio crackles, and an extraordinary tale begins.

Big fan of the novel. This was a bit of mish mash of a show. Some modern setting, bit of dance, some scenes set in the past. It just didn’t really stick. Liked the stage setup. Wanted a bit more out of it. Ended up being a bit of a disappointment. 

### 14) [Blood Brothers](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/blood-brothers-2/)
> Written by Willy Russell, the legendary Blood Brothers tells the captivating and moving tale of twins who, separated at birth, grow up on opposite sides of the tracks, only to meet again with fateful consequences.

Lots of rustling packets by the audience in this show. Quite off putting. Biggest thing that was odd was seeing adults playing as children. Didn’t love that. I find it hard to believe the 45 year old in front of me is actually a 8 year old boy.
Nice songs though, it was fine. Wouldn’t see again.

### 13) [Jamie Hutchinson](https://jamiehcomedy.com/)
Quite intense and blue but a laugh on a random Friday night. 

### 12) [Peter Pan Goes Wrong](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/peter-pan-goes-wrong/)
> The members of the Cornley Drama Society are back on stage, battling technical hitches, flying mishaps and cast disputes as they attempt to present J.M Barrie’s much-loved tale. But will they ever make it to Neverland?

Solid farce. Very much a panto atmosphere. Lots of falling over and silly behaviour but could turn your brain off and go with it. One of the actresses gave a touching speech at the end which is always nice to see.

### 11) [39 Steps](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/the-39-steps/) 
> The 39 Steps took Broadway by storm, played in 39 different countries across the globe, and delighted over 3 million people worldwide with its quintessentially plucky spirit and dashing sense of fun.

Saw a man ejected in the interval. Not sure why but someone wasn’t very happy. More slapstick, lots of cackles in the audience. Older crowd for this but fine. 

### 10) [Drop the Dead Donkey](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/drop-the-dead-donkey/) 
> Starring the original cast members Susannah Doyle, Robert Duncan, Ingrid Lacey, Neil Pearson, Jeff Rawle, Stephen Tompkinson and Victoria Wicks, the iconic BAFTA and EMMY award-winning comedy is reimagined in this brand-new topical commentary on the cutthroat world of 24 hours news.

Old crowd again. They absolutely loved it though. I wasn’t that familiar with the original show but it had some decent jokes. Some unexpected North Korea references. Wasn’t the best thing you’ll ever see but passable. 

### 9) [Wor Bella](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/wor-bella/)
> They selflessly saved the war effort on the home front during WWI and still found time to play football! The incredible story of women’s football during WWI and how Blyth Spartans Ladies won the Munitionettes Cup in 1918.

Another older crowd. Really hanging with the golden oldies with some of these shows. It was a nicely done show, some surprise appearances. Easy watch.

### 8) [A Song For Ella Grey](https://northernstage.co.uk/whats-on/a-song-for-ella-grey/) 
> This new production, from the Company that brought you Noughts & Crosses, is a magical retelling of the Orpheus myth, full of music, sound and storytelling. Claire and her best friend, Ella Grey, are ordinary kids from ordinary families in an ordinary world. They and their friends fall in and out of love, play music and dance, stare at the stars, yearn for excitement, and have parties on the beautiful beaches of Northumberland. One day a stranger, a musician called Orpheus, appears on the beach, and entrances them all but particularly Ella. Where has Orpheus come from and what path will Ella follow?  A tale of modern teenagers and ancient forces, a tale told since the dawn of time and told again today.

Well acted, including an influencer/comedian in a lead role. She did pretty great I’d say. Set was quite earthy and well done. It won’t be the last production where Orpheus pops up in 2024.

### 7) [An Officer and a Gentleman](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/an-officer-and-a-gentleman/)
> Be part of the emotional journey of Zack Mayo, a fearless young officer candidate, and the captivating Paula Pokrifki, whose fiery spirit matches his own. Their encounters ignite a spark that transcends boundaries, awakening a passionate love that defies all odds.

A bit trashy for sure... but still a fun paint by numbers show. Jukebox musical with good songs. Dubious character arcs but all a bit silly in a good way. 

### 6) [Wizard of Oz](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/wizard-of-oz/) 
> Join Dorothy, Toto, and friends on an unforgettable adventure down the yellow brick road to the merry old land of Oz.

Loved the Lion character. Big fan. Quite a fun production, lots of video and set changes. It’s probably exactly what you expect so did not disappoint. 

### 5) [Underdog](https://northernstage.co.uk/whats-on/underdog-the-other-other-bronte/) 
> Charlotte Brontë has a confession to make about how one sister became an idol, and the other became known as the third sister. You know the one. No, not that one. The other, other one… Anne. This is not a story about well-behaved women. This is a story about the power of words. It’s about sisters and sisterhood, love and jealousy, support and competition.

Quite funny, evil Charlotte Brontë. Poor Anne not getting her dues. Solid production, worth seeing. 

### 4) [Here You Come Again](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/here-you-come-again/)
> Packed with the iconic songs Jolene, 9 to 5, Islands in the Stream, I Will Always Love You, Here You Come Again and more, this lively and touching new musical tells the story of a diehard fan whose fantasy version of international icon Dolly Parton gets him through trying times.

A whole show centred around Dolly Parton! Was extremely enjoyable. The lead guy was insanely enthusiastic and carried the show brilliantly. The older couple next to me were chatty but very nice. They loved the songs (even if I didn’t know a good chunk of them).

### 3) [James Acaster](https://www.jamesacaster.com/) 

![James Acaster performing](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/AcasterVaud011118_%2845011799794%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/720px-AcasterVaud011118_%2845011799794%29_%28cropped%29.jpg?20210730164808)

Heckler’s welcome tour. I was right in the splash zone and very close to the front. I didn’t heckle but had some funny audience interaction. Audience was very respectful and nice, no evil heckles at all.

### 2) [Everybody's Talking About Jamie](https://www.theatreroyal.co.uk/whats-on/everybodys-talking-about-jamie-2/) 
> Jamie New is sixteen and lives on a council estate in Sheffield. Jamie doesn’t quite fit in. Jamie is terrified about the future. Jamie is going to be a sensation. Supported by his brilliant loving mum and surrounded by his friends, Jamie overcomes prejudice, beats the bullies and steps out of the darkness, into the spotlight. This ‘Funny, outrageous, touching’ (Daily Telegraph), musical sensation is to be experienced by all the family and not to be missed!
 
I’d never seen this so finally got around to seeing it. We had a stand-in for the role of Jamie who was absolutely brilliant. Hugo Battersby / Loco Chanelle was a very likeable character/performance too. It was wonderful, very joyous. Can see why it was so popular. Very feel good hit!

### 1) [The Bounds](https://www.live.org.uk/whats-on/bounds)
> This is the big one, and it’s been raging for hours. Percy and Ro are stuck on the boundaries, again, on a pitch that stretches as far as the eye can see. Something’s different this year, something’s on the change. The ground is frozen hard as Weardale granite, men in black cloaks beat the bounds with willow branches, and a strange light is burning in the sky.

![Two actors looking shocked in a field](https://www.live.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/lt_landscape/public/images/9428_The_Bounds_Website-image-1500-x-1090.jpg?itok=KNPDvYWA)

Experimental, raw and political. Excellent little theatre too. The whole plot takes a strange turn towards the end but very interesting throughout, could be quite funny too. Not sure this will ever tour but was very promising. 

#### What is next?
Average score for the first 6 months of shows was 77.16%. Not bad but not stellar! No 90+ scores yet! I am writing this in September though and I can promise you it does get better! The average score across all of 2023 for shows was 78.5% so that's the score to beat!

Some stuff I’m looking forward to that I’ve not see yet:
- [A Face in the Crowd](https://www.youngvic.org/whats-on/face-the-crowd)
- [Stranger Things](https://www.thephoenixtheatre.co.uk/shows/stranger-things-the-first-shadow)
- [Dr. Strangelove](https://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk/whats-on/dr-strangelove)

Let's hope for a higher average in the latter part of 2024!
