# Why report?
In 2021 I tried to write an exercise report every single month. Yes, I know. A lot right!?!

[Here is the December 2021 edition in which I summarise the entire year](https://colinpattinson.github.io/exercise-2021-12/).

My main motivations for doing so were to keep myself accountable & trick myself into doing more. Largely it worked. I racked up over 1750 miles across all activities. Which I am relatively happy with.

## So what about 2022?
Well, I set myself a different goal. I was done with the x12 blog posts and opted to aim to do yoga at least 365 times across the year. Largely once per day (but sometimes this was inconvenient as I was on a plane or simply because I started it a few mins after midnight so technically not every day). The good news is this was done with flying colours. So much so, Iâ€™m doing it again in 2023. 
Highlight must be doing a yoga session up in Jungle-y Costa Rica with monkeys and eagles swooping by as I tried to follow along with some random YouTube video. Low light is showing off my downward facing dog progress outside a pub in Putney with colleagues. 

### What else apart from yoga?
I actually did quite a bit more than just the 365 sessions of yoga.

I hiked:

I cycled and swam:

I also ran:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pleasant 13 laps around a BMX track this morn. <a href="https://t.co/RQOwX05yIi">pic.twitter.com/RQOwX05yIi</a></p>&mdash; Colin Pattinson (@ColinPattinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ColinPattinson/status/1573625008819159044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Originally I was signed up to the Windsor half marathon but with the Queenâ€™s death I had to switch to an alternative pretty sharpish hence the need of all the laps around a BMX track.

#### Running stats
According to Strava it looked like I did 114 runs in the 2022 calendar year. With a total time of 73 hours running, a distance of 508 miles and an elevation gain of 7,887 feet.

Or in other words I could of watched Back to the Future nearly 37 times instead of running, or ran the same distance as Norwich to Berlin or scaled [Mount Mailindang](https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=12957).

## What next?
I really want to increase the amount I swim. Perhaps a nice accompaniment to all the running. I have a few runs scheduled, some 10k's and some half marathons which should be fun. No blog posting though. I shall save that for January 2024.
