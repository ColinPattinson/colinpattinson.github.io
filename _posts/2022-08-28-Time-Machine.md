I am sitting here with access to [OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 tool](https://labs.openai.com/), some free credits and feeling ready for a lark. 

# Context
First, let's set the scene:

## What is DALL-E 2? 
An AI that has been fed a lot of images in order for a human to write a free text prompt and create some original art or image. 

I probably should add that almost certainly the training data used to make these images are biased, you can read smarter people than me about this issue but certainly worth looking into. Likewise, there are deep concerns about art created from parroting real artists. Interesting topics but will not dive deep into these for this silly blog post.

## What should I try to create?
I’ve just listened to an amazing podcast which smushes a lot of my interests together.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/0wkD9ffGeG24pZlAe4ETWW?utm_source=generator&t=0" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

It combines history, comedy, time, politics & Geordie’s. I’ve pulled out x3 interesting snippets and I’m going to try and see if I can visualise these nuggets! WARNING: This web page is going to be very very very heavy with images! I’ve tried to compress them but am very sorry if this page has taken a zillion years to load.

# How?
There are a couple of resources that I am using and highly recommend:
* [I spent $15 in DALL·E 2 credits creating this AI image, and here’s what I learned](https://pub.towardsai.net/i-spent-15-in-dall-e-2-credits-creating-this-ai-image-and-heres-what-i-learned-52f352912025) blogpost
* [DALL-E 2 prompt guide](https://pitch.com/v/DALL-E-prompt-book-v1-tmd33y)

# The Experiment
I'm going to try explain why I've picked the subject. Then I'm going to co-create some accompanying image/art for it. 

## Time Heist
Many moons ago the Roman Republic was having a war with the Carthaginian Empire. The [First Punic War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Punic_War) is raging over on the island of Scilily. The Roman spoils of war is [a sun dial which gets plonked on a column](https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/monumental-timekeepers) in the centre of Rome. This was Rome’s first sundial and would spark many more popping up across Roman lands. 

Not everyone loved it though and the regiment of time began to intrude on people’s lives. Much to the annoyance of some. A playwright of the day writing:

> The gods damn that man who first discovered the hours, and—​yes—​who first set up a sundial here, who’s smashed the day into bits for poor me! You know, when I was a boy, my stomach was the only sundial, by far the best and truest compared to all of these. It used to warn me to eat, wherever—except when there was nothing. But now what there is, isn’t eaten unless the sun says so.

Interesting. Lets see what a machine & I can concoct…

### Results
3x attempts to reach something reasonable. First round a bit of a dud but tweaked the prompt to be:

> A gloomy old man wearing a toga, shaking fist at a sundial, outdoors, in Roman Empire, in the style of an ancient Roman painting

My favourites are…

I also tried one in the style of “ancient Roman mosaic”.

![A Roman mosaic of a white Roman man in yoga shaking fist at sky](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2013.27.37%20-%20A%20gloomy%20old%20man%20wearing%20a%20toga,%20shaking%20fist%20at%20a%20sundial,%20outdoors,%20in%20Roman%20Empire,%20in%20the%20style%20of%20an%20ancient%20Roman%20mosaic%20-min.png?raw=true)

## Smelling Clock
We’ve not always used dials for our eyes to sense time. We’ve had cockerels to cock a doodle do us in our ears. We’ve also used our noses apparently...

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FnPQM6-paew" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In essence different smells can indicate different times. Perhaps this already happens as the faint whiff of coffee or freshly eaten cheerios indicate morning in some parts of the world. Just googling this I am finding the idea is not dead, this decade the Guardian wrote [Wake up and smell the bacon-scented iPhone alarm clock](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/06/wake-up-and-smell-the-bacon-scented-iphone-alarm-clock) and 2,685 people [investing in a smelly alarm clock](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sensorwake-trio-the-scent-based-alarm-clock#/). 

Lets try be a bit more expressive and let DALL-E 2 be a bit wilder with what a smelly clock could be…

### Results
X4 total attempts. Spoiler: this doesn't go well.

Just using:

> A smelling clock

Produced these types of images…

![A man smelling a clock](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2013.31.19%20-%20A%20smelling%20clock-min.png?raw=true)

Fine but could get something more fun. Sadly “Exciting, psychedelic, smelling clock” didn’t produce anything but multi-coloured looking clocks.

> A big nose smelling an exciting, psychedelic looking clock from the future

Produced some interesting responses…

![A big nose in front of a purple melting clock](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2013.35.28%20-%20A%20big%20nose%20smelling%20an%20exciting,%20psychedelic%20looking%20clock%20from%20the%20future-min.png?raw=true)

![A snout in the centre of a picture with a swirling background](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2013.35.49%20-%20A%20big%20nose%20smelling%20an%20exciting,%20psychedelic%20looking%20clock%20from%20the%20future-min.png?raw=true)

I continued with playing and to be honest they got progressively more haunting.

![A woman with her nose pressed firmly against a clock](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2013.43.21%20-%20A%20lady%20smelling%20a%20clock,%20medium%20shot,%20low%20angle,%20golden%20hour,%20in%20the%20style%20of%20Dr.%20Seuss%20-min.png?raw=true)

When I tried “Dada clock shaped like a nose” it got more disturbing.

![A big nose and tongue sticking out of a clock](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2013.45.46%20-%20Dada%20clock%20shaped%20like%20a%20nose%20-min.png?raw=true)

I resigned to failure after trying “Art Deco poster for a clock shaped like a nose”.

![A big nose in the Art Deco style](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2013.47.38%20-%20Art%20Deco%20poster%20for%20a%20clock%20shaped%20like%20a%20nose%20-min.png?raw=true)

Verdict. Fail. I couldn't get the prompt to WOW me. Instead everything just seemed too literal. 

## Grandfather Clock
The name of the “grandfather clock” actually comes from a song. A song about how the tick tock of a 90 year old’s clock matches the same beat of his life. Johnny Cash even did a rendition:

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/46ilYvQHebp419ByvKTJpk?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

So with that wholesome image in our heads lets try recreate a beautiful scene.

### Results
OK… first results don't scream wholesome…

> Johnny Cash singing with his back against a grandfather clock

![Cartoon Johnny Cash next to a grandfather clock](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2014.07.01%20-%20Johnny%20Cash%20singing%20with%20his%20back%20against%20a%20grandfather%20clock-min.png?raw=true)

Maybe a little better?

![A mash up of a tv and grandfather clock next to a cartoony Johnny Cash](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2014.06.50%20-%20Johnny%20Cash%20singing%20with%20his%20back%20against%20a%20grandfather%20clock-min.png?raw=true)

More improvements with “Johnny Cash playing his guitar next to a grandfather clock” but not giving me the sweet wholesome quality I’m after…

![A dark haunting version of a distorted Johnny Cash next to a grandfather clock](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2014.08.06%20-%20Johnny%20Cash%20playing%20his%20guitar%20next%20to%20a%20grandfather%20clock-min.png?raw=true)

I then tried a variation of “A wholesome Johnny Cash playing his guitar next to a grandfather clock in the style of Hayao Miyazaki (Studio Ghibli)” which did produce something relatively interesting that borders sweet.

![A Studio Ghibli retelling of Johnny Cash sitting and playing his guitar in front of a grandfather clock](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2014.10.11%20-%20Johnny%20Cash%20playing%20his%20guitar%20next%20to%20a%20grandfather%20clock%20in%20the%20style%20of%20Hayao%20Miyazaki%20(Studio%20Ghibli)-min.png?raw=true)

![A sort of childs drawing of Johnny Cash playing to kids in front of a grandfather clock](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2014.11.40%20-%20A%20wholesome%20Johnny%20Cash%20playing%20his%20guitar%20next%20to%20a%20grandfather%20clock%20in%20the%20style%20of%20Hayao%20Miyazaki%20(Studio%20Ghibli)%20in%20front%20of%20some%20sitting%20childre-min.png?raw=true)

Just to be wild I thought let's bow out with something a bit more rock’n’roll. Those are good but I've got 1 credit left and lets see roll the dice one final time.

> Johnny Cash playing his guitar on top of a grandfather clock while playing in a prison that is on fire

Produces…

![A distorted Johnny Cash sitting on top of a grandfather clock with flames at the bottom of the picture](https://github.com/ColinPattinson/colinpattinson.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/DALL%C2%B7E%202022-08-28%2014.13.58%20-%20Johnny%20Cash%20playing%20his%20guitar%20on%20top%20of%20a%20grandfather%20clock%20while%20playing%20in%20a%20prison%20that%20is%20on%20fire-min.png?raw=true)

Overall, not bad actually. Not perfect but largely these Cash inspired images hit my brief quite well.

# Conclusion
Well that was entirely superfluous. Some might say it was a waste of time, I would say listen to the podcast and reimagine what time and timekeeping means.

In relation to DALL-E 2, well it's scary and fun. I was entertained by it but obviously it sort of requires the human to be trained on how best to prompt to illicit the best images. If you hate the images produced, blame machines.
